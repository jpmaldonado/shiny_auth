# PwC Template

This draws on code from [shiny_auth](https://github.com/PaulC91/shiny_auth). It has the branding of PwC as per summer 2020. 

The app allows you to pass a `user_base` dataframe with `user` `password` `permissions` fields to an authentication module. If login criteria is met, the module will pass a `user_info` list back to the main app from which you can dynamically load and serve different data and UI components based on the assigned permissions of the logged in user.
